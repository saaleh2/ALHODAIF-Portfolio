Meaning that candidates can only get thair certificate if they apply what they have learned in real life projects. Candidates projects get checked by experts to evaluate thair work and make sure they have fulfil Udacityies&#39; requirments. . This project uses NYSE dataset for over 450 companies. It includs companies&#39; financials data for four years, period date, sector, and industory. Here&#39;s a look at dataset head: . To pass this project I&#39;ve been asked to attain two requirments: . Find an insight from the data and tell a story about it through presntation. | Build a dynamic financial predection dashboard in excel for all companies. | . Find insights in the data . The dataset includes financial data from 2012 to 2016. The first thing came to my mind of that period is when oil price hit 120$ in 2012, and then fall down in 2015. I was wondering how airline industy did during that period. Why airline? because during that time I was studying in China and I&#39;ve noticed that airline ticket prices were geting more and more expensive. So I wanted to see if there&#39;s a correlation between ticket prices and oil prices to confirm my hypothesis. In general, if oil prices goes up or down it effects many aspects of the global economy, some sectors benifit from high prices but most of them benifit from lower prices. my qustion was &quot;how was airline companies&#39; financial perfomance during that period?&quot; My assumtion was that high oil prices will increase the cost of airline opratoins, which therefore increase the price of tickets. High ticket prices lead to lower demand and therefore lower profits. . Extracting EBIT from data . The main benchmarks I used to answer my qustion is total revenue and EBIT (earnings before interst and tax). There&#39;s other factors that could tell you about companyies perfomance, but these two are good for my qustion. We don&#39;t have EBIT in the dataset, But luckly we have the row data to extract EBIT. To do that, First I found the Gross Profit by subtracting Cost of Goods Sold from Total Revenue then we get EBIT by subtracting Sales, General and Admin from Gross Profit. Laslty, I used the wonderful pivot table tool, to get average, median, and standard devistion of the two benchmarks mentioned earlier. Using them all together will give us more accurate insight. . Here&#39;s the result on excel: . . Average EBIT &amp; revenue . . Median EBIT . . EBIT standard deviation . Here&#39;s my insights in clean slides: . .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
